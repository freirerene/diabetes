# Early Stage Diabetes Detection

We use the dataset "Early stage diabetes risk prediction dataset", provided by M M Faniqul Islam, Rahatara Ferdousi, Sadikur Rahman, Humayra, and Yasmin Bushra, to predict the risk of early stage diabetes using XGBoost classification. We also adjust the cut off point to optmize the prediction, using the auc score as a function of the cut off point.
